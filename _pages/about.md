title: About Me
subtitle: I am a person who has always been drawn to creativity and rationality. Moving from an Italian ‘humanistic’ high school to a physics degree, then from a sound art career to a new Data Science challenge, I finally found a balance thanks to the immersive course at General Assembly.
Maths gave me the curiosity to ask questions and the patience to answer them. Art gave me the capacity to change point of view and try different approaches to solve problems.
During the General Assembly course, I studied all the main machine learning tools and techniques. I learned how to plan and deliver a project, to analyse and visualise data, and to create predictive models. Now I am ready to start my new career as a Junior Data Scientist. This is an exciting starting point, for my career but also for my personal development. I am looking forward to apply these new skills in my new role and in my spare time.
